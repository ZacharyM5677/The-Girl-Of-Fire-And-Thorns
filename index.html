            I got married today to King Alejandro of Joya d’Arena. It's my 16th birthday. I <br>
            barely know him, and my dress feels like it’s squeezing the life <br>
            out of me. Everyone keeps saying I’m chosen by God, but honestly <br>
            I feel nervous, and not important at all. I really hope <br>
            I don’t embarrass my whole kingdom. I have a Godstone in my navel,<br>
            which signals I'm truly chosen by god. It's useless to me, though;<br>
            It does nothing but tingle with a warm sensation when I prey.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            This desert never ends. It’s just pure heat. Alejandro barely <br>
            talks to me, I just wish this was over. I have to travel to a desert<br>
            country called Joya d'Arena which was about to be at war with the country<br>
            of Invierne. I don't want to fight a war, I want to know what this gem<br>
            in my navel is meant to be for.<br> 
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            They showed up fast. Loud drums, fire everywhere, horses screaming.<br>
            The Invierne. I tried to help Aneaxi, my lady-in-waiting, when the carriage flipped, but<br>
            her leg broke. She didn’t scream, but she looked like she was in pain.<br>
            I just froze. I couldn’t move or do anything helpful. What’s the point<br>
            of this Godstone if I can’t even protect someone?<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            After we arrived to Joya d'Arena, Aneaxi died. She never<br>
            told us how bad her wound really was. She didn’t want to make<br>
            things harder for us, but her wound got infected; The infection<br>
            spread and killed her. I feel like it’s my fault, I wasn’t <br>
            careful enough. I’ll never forget her.
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            This morning I woke up in a carriage, but I wasn't able to move.<br>
            Turns out a friend from Joya d'Arena, Cosme, and her brother, Humberto,<br>
            put me in a carriage to go to a desert village. I couldnt move because they<br>
            used duerma leafs, they slow or stop movement entierly. I guess they used<br>
            it to keep me still. It's unsettling, though.
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            We made it to the village. They were really unorgianized and were in<br>
            desparate need of a leader. After staying for a couple days, they<br>
            had a new leader; me. We all formed a group called the Malficio.<br>
            I never thought I would ever be suited as a leader.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            Cosme, Humberto, and I all were traveling back, and took a pitstop<br>
            at a cave. My Godstone had gone cold, signaling the Inviernes arrival.<br>
            I have no idea how they found us, but they captured us. I thought it<br>
            would be over, but at least they don't know I have a Godstone.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            They brang me to a sorcerer. They tried to mind control me with an<br>
            amulet with the Godstone of the previous Godstone bearer from a hundred<br>
            years ago. The Godstone should've been dead because its bearer was dead,<br>
            But somehow the amulet reactivated it. Their attempt to mind control me<br>
            failed, as I was a godstone bearer. I pretended to fall under the control<br>
            to avoid suspicion. I was taken to a tent alone with only me and the sorcerer.<br>
            He stepped out for a second after placing wine on the table. I noticed duerma<br>
            berries on the table, Duerma berries are known for their ability to put people asleep.<br>
            I crushed some into his drink while he was gone. He came back and drank some,<br>
            and soon fell asleep. I used this opprotunity to put on his cloak,<br>
            steal his amulet, and burn the tent with his candle. By putting on<br>
            his cloak, I was able to disguise as him and leave the camp without any suspicion.<br>
            Luckily, I met up with Cosme and Humberto not too long after.
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            As we were traveling, the father of Alejandro's mistress, Conde Trevino, sent a letter to us,<br>
            wanting to ally with us. Me, Cosme, and Humberto decided to go meet up with him.<br>
            Worst mistake ever. Once we got there, he captured us. Turns out Trevino was allied with the Invierne.<br>
            He took Humberto and I to a room where Trevino asked me to disclose the location of<br>
            the village where the Malficio was located. I refused. Trevino then killed Humberto<br>
            after Humberto lied of being the leader of Malficio and to not hurt me. Right as he was<br>
            about to die, he spoke of his love for me. After he died, Me and the rest managed to escape<br>
            back to the capital of Joya d'Arena. On the way back, I couldn't stop thinking about Humbertos<br>
            death.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            After making it back to the capital, Alejandro barely recognised me. I<br>
            guess that shows how much I've grown, huh? I didn't have much time to<br>
            celebrate though, as the Invierne launched a violent attack against the capital.<br>
            Many were killed or hurt badly, so I needed to do something fast. I decided<br>
            to use the amulet I had gotten from my time at the Inviernes camp and<br>
            use its power along with my Godstone. The power of my Godstone and the amulet<br>
            combined created a huge magical blast which killed or hurt many of the Invierne.<br>
            That move alone made them retreat. Alejandro was deeply injured from the<br>
            attack, and would die very soon. Before he died, he trusted me to be<br>
            Queen of Joya d'Arena. I shall bring this country to a new age!

            <h1> Summary </h1>
            <br>
            The Girl of Fire and Thorns is about a girl named Lucero-Elisa, <br>
            a princess from Orovalle who is chosen by God and carries a <br>
            powerful gem called the Godstone in her navel. At the <br>
            start of the story, she doesn't feel confident in herself. She thinks <br>
            she's too chubby, short, and the opposite of brave. On her 16th birthday, <br>
            she’s forced to marry a king named Alejandro from a desert <br>
            kingdom called Joya d'Arena. She doesn’t know him, and she’s nervous <br>
            due to her insucurities.<br><br>

            As Elisa travels to her new home, their group is attacked by the <br>
            Invierne, an enemy nation with dead Godstones which are being <br>
            used for their power via special amulets. During the attack, one <br>
            of Elisa’s closest companions, Aneaxi, gets badly hurt. Later, Aneaxi dies <br>
            because her injury becomes infected, and Elisa feels guilty for not noticing <br>
            the injury sooner. This is one of the first moments that shows Elisa starting <br>
            to care for others and take responsibility.<br><br>

            Later in the story, Elisa gets taken away by some of her friends, and<br>
            finds a village away from the capital of Joya d'Arena. ends up becoming a leader
            of a rebel group called the Malficio. She helps poor or damaged villages and stands up to <br>
            the Invierne. She gets kidnapped by a powerful Invierne sorcerer but tricks <br>
            him and escapes by using duerma berries (a sleeping drug) and some<br>
            clever thinking after he falls asleep from the berries. She steals a Godstone amulet from the <br>
            sorcerer, which helps her later.<br><br>

            Eventually, Elisa loses someone she cares about, Humberto, who might have <br>
            loved her. She realizes she doesn’t really love King Alejandro, but still <br>
            chose to protect his people. She returns to the capital of Joya d'Arena. <br>
            Alejandro almost didn't recognize Elisa, showing how much Elisa has evolved<br>
            over the story. As a final attempt, the Invierne invate the capital in attempt<br>
            to kill Elisa for her Godstone once in for all. In the final battle, Elisa uses the <br>
            Godstone and the amulet she stole to defeat the Invierne army. <br>
            Alejandro dies from injuries, and Elisa becomes the Queen of Joya d'Arena. <br>
            She has grown into a strong and brave leader.<br><br>

            For my project, I made a social media profile that shows how Elisa <br>
            changes throughout the book. In her early posts, I tried to make her sound <br>
            insecure about herself, just like she is in the beginning <br>
            of the book. As the posts go on, she becomes more confident. <br>
            I made sure to add posts about important events, like the caravan <br>
            attack, Aneaxi’s death, and her time with the Malficio. I also <br>
            showed her relationships with people like Ximena, Humberto, and King Alejandro.<br><br>
