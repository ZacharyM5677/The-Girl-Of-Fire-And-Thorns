            I got married today to King Alejandro of Joya d’Arena. It's my 16th birthday. I <br>
            barely know him, and my dress feels like it’s squeezing the life <br>
            out of me. Everyone keeps saying I’m chosen by God, but honestly <br>
            I feel nervous, and not important at all. I really hope <br>
            I don’t embarrass my whole kingdom. I have a Godstone in my navel,<br>
            which signals I'm truly chosen by god. It's useless to me, though;<br>
            It does nothing but tingle with a warm sensation when I prey.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            This desert never ends. It’s just pure heat. Alejandro barely <br>
            talks to me, I just wish this was over. I have to travel to a desert<br>
            country called Joya d'Arena which was about to be at war with the country<br>
            of Invierne. I don't want to fight a war, I want to know what this gem<br>
            in my navel is meant to be for.<br> 
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            They showed up fast. Loud drums, fire everywhere, horses screaming.<br>
            The Invierne. I tried to help Aneaxi, my lady-in-waiting, when the carriage flipped, but<br>
            her leg broke. She didn’t scream, but she looked like she was in pain.<br>
            I just froze. I couldn’t move or do anything helpful. What’s the point<br>
            of this Godstone if I can’t even protect someone?<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            After we arrived to Joya d'Arena, Aneaxi died. She never<br>
            told us how bad her wound really was. She didn’t want to make<br>
            things harder for us, but her wound got infected; The infection<br>
            spread and killed her. I feel like it’s my fault, I wasn’t <br>
            careful enough. I’ll never forget her.

            <h1> Summary </h1>
            <br>
            The Girl of Fire and Thorns is about a girl named Lucero-Elisa, <br>
            a princess from Orovalle who is chosen by God and carries a <br>
            powerful gem called the Godstone in her navel. At the <br>
            start of the story, she doesn't feel confident in herself. She thinks <br>
            she's too chubby, short, and the opposite of brave. On her 16th birthday, <br>
            she’s forced to marry a king named Alejandro from a desert <br>
            kingdom called Joya d'Arena. She doesn’t know him, and she’s nervous <br>
            due to her insucurities.<br><br>

            As Elisa travels to her new home, their group is attacked by the <br>
            Invierne, an enemy nation with dead Godstones which are being <br>
            used for their power via special amulets. During the attack, one <br>
            of Elisa’s closest companions, Aneaxi, gets badly hurt. Later, Aneaxi dies <br>
            because her injury becomes infected, and Elisa feels guilty for not noticing <br>
            the injury sooner. This is one of the first moments that shows Elisa starting <br>
            to care for others and take responsibility.<br><br>

            Later in the story, Elisa gets taken away by some of her friends, and<br>
            finds a village away from the capital of Joya d'Arena. ends up becoming a leader
            of a rebel group called the Malficio. She helps poor or damaged villages and stands up to <br>
            the Invierne. She gets kidnapped by a powerful Invierne sorcerer but tricks <br>
            him and escapes by using duerma berries (a sleeping drug) and some<br>
            clever thinking after he falls asleep from the berries. She steals a Godstone amulet from the <br>
            sorcerer, which helps her later.<br><br>

            Eventually, Elisa loses someone she cares about, Humberto, who might have <br>
            loved her. She realizes she doesn’t really love King Alejandro, but still <br>
            chose to protect his people. She returns to the capital of Joya d'Arena. <br>
            Alejandro almost didn't recognize Elisa, showing how much Elisa has evolved<br>
            over the story. As a final attempt, the Invierne invate the capital in attempt<br>
            to kill Elisa for her Godstone once in for all. In the final battle, Elisa uses the <br>
            Godstone and the amulet she stole to defeat the Invierne army. <br>
            Alejandro dies from injuries, and Elisa becomes the Queen of Joya d'Arena. <br>
            She has grown into a strong and brave leader.<br><br>

            For my project, I made a social media profile that shows how Elisa <br>
            changes throughout the book. In her early posts, I tried to make her sound <br>
            insecure about herself, just like she is in the beginning <br>
            of the book. As the posts go on, she becomes more confident. <br>
            I made sure to add posts about important events, like the caravan <br>
            attack, Aneaxi’s death, and her time with the Malficio. I also <br>
            showed her relationships with people like Ximena, Humberto, and King Alejandro.<br><br>
