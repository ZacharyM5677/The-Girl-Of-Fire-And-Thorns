            I'm Lucero-Elisa de Riqueza, Princess of Orovalle; Chosen by god,<br>
            represented by a blue gem in my navel people call the <br>
            "God Stone." Today is my 16th birthday, and have the privallige<br>
            of getting married while wearing a suffocating terno. I'm too chubby;<br>
            My head is swirrling from my ternos suffocation, and I look so ugly and short.<br>
            All I can hope is that my husband is ugly, so when he divorces me,<br>
            I feel nothing from how ugly he is. My nurse and guardian, Ximena, <br>
            and my lady-in-waiting, Aneaxi, helped me get dressed for the wedding.<br>
            Wish me luck!<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            My husband was so handsome, I quite literally froze in shock when<br>
            he pulled up my linen veil to look at my face. He crouched and smiled<br>
            at me, and I tried to smile back; My cheeks had failed to obey.<br>
            He is Alejandro de Vega of Joya d'Arena.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            I was told I had to leave to a desert country named Joya d'Arena<br>
            to help fight a war with the country of Invierne.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            Today was a disaster, Aneaxi almost died. We were traveling in a caravan to<br>
            Joya d'Arena, and everything was going smoothly. I was in a carriage with<br>
            Ximena and Aneaxi. Soon however, we heard drums in the distance—drums<br>
            where there should've been none; It was the Invierne. They began thrashing<br>
            our carriges; including mine and my husbands. Me, Ximena, and Aneaxi<br>
            went through the trapdoor on the floor which led us below the carriage<br>
            , but I fell on Aneaxi and had broken her leg. Me and Ximena had to<br>
            move from the bottom to the side of the carriage and yank Aneaxi out.<br>
            Our carriage began to burst into flames somehow, the Invierne weren't<br>
            even close. The horses on our carriage were about to move; Ximena and I<br>
            began to panic. We yanked Aneaxi hard, but she wouldn't budge. Luckily,<br>
            somebody had cut the string connecting the body of the carriage to the<br>
            horses. We yanked out Aneaxi, but not before a blood curdling scream<br>
            erupted from her chest. Once she was free from the bottom of the carriage,<br>
            we ran and ran until we couldn't run anymore. We had almost died.<br>
            Once the Invierne retreated, we all returned back to Orovalle;<br>
            some injured, some dead. What a nightmare today..<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            On the trip to Joya d'Arena, Aneaxi died. She didn't want us to feel bad<br>
            for her or waste resources on her, so she didn't tell us she had a gaping<br>
            scar on the back of her leg. She got it when me and Ximena yanked her<br>
            from the bottom of the carriage. Because she decided not to tell us,<br>
            it had gotten infected and killed her. I wish she told us sooner.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            Ximena, The one who gave me the script about the God Stone, andsada<br>
            We reached a troubled village and decided to use this opprotunity and<br>
            get them to help us fight the invierne. They were in desperate need of a<br>
            leader; I decided to stay for a bit to gain their trust, and then took over<br>
            role of leader. I told them we must come together-even the ones who<br>
            are hurt or young-and fight the invierne. After that, we kept going<br>
            on our journey.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            While we were traveling, we headed to a pitstop at a cave. we got <br>
            there and settled for a few days, but we didn't leave before my God<br>
            Stone had gone cold. That was signaling the Inviernes arrival, and at<br>
            the time I had no idea how they found us. Humberto and Cosme left<br>
            the cave and promised to come back once they were sure they were<br>
            safe. that didnt go to plan though, as we all ended up getting<br>
            captured eventually.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            I was taken to an Animagus; a sorcerer from Invierne who also bears <br>
            a "God Stone" of sorts. It's an amulet; letting him control a person.<br>
            However, I have the God Stone aswell; I was Immune to his attempts.<br>
            I decided to fool him though, so I pretended it worked on me.<br>
            He stepped out for a second after placing drinks on the table.<br>
            I noticed duerma berries on the side of the table, best known as <br>
            being sedative. I crushed some into his drink; He came back, drank it,<br>
            and passed out not long after. I used this opprotunity to put on his<br>
            cloak and amulet, burn the tent we were in with the candle on the table,<br>
            and fake being him while seamlessle leaving the camp.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            I managed to find Cosmé and Humberto again. I found out that<br>
            Humberto might have loved me. I didn't think I loved Alejandro<br>
            back after this long journey, and I thought of doing something<br>
            about that when I got the chance. I didn't have much of a<br>
            chance though; Alejandro has a mistress whos fathers name is Conde<br>
            Treviño. He sent us a letter of intrest of allying with us and our village<br>
            group, who we all call the Malficio. We agreed; Humberto, Cosmé,<br>
            and I met up with him in his country. He ended up capturing us. Turns<br>
            out Treviño had an alliance with the Invierne. He asked me and Humberto<br>
            privatly to disclose the location of our village base. After I refused, he<br>
            threataned to kill my allies that came with me. After I still didn't budge,<br>
            Humberto claimed to be the leader of the Malficio; Treviño saw through<br>
            the lie, and killed Humberto right as Humberto began to confess his love<br>
            for me.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
            out Treviño had an alliance with the Invierne. He asked me and Humberto<br>
            We almost died making it back to the capital that night. King Alejandro<br>
            didn't notice me until I specifically told him who I was. That really shows<br>
            how much I had changed, huh? He had finally publically announced me as<br>
            his wife after way too much time; you thought that would've already<br>
            happened by the time we arrived at Joya d'Arena. Soon however, the<br>
            Invierne had come to strike again; at the capital, this time. I didn't<br>
            mention this earlier, but when I was kidnapped at the Inviernes camp, I<br>
            had stolen many of their God Stones and the amulet of the animagi I<br>
            had escaped from. I devised a counter to make the Invierne retreat;<br>
            I put many of the godstones in the amulet, and with the power of my<br>
            living God Stone combined with the power of the dead ones in the<br>
            amulet, I made an ultra-powerful blast that left the Invierne running in<br>
            hopes of survival. Alejandro had taken many bad injuries, and was about<br>
            to die. Before he died, he told me he had trusted me to protect the son of<br>
            him and his late wife, and he labeled me Queen of Joya d'Arena. I shall<br>
            take this country into a new era!<br>
